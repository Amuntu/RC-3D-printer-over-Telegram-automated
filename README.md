# RC-3D-printer-over-Telegram-automated
At the Robotics Club of Tishreen University, we faced challenges with managing the scheduling of our 3D printing system. To address this issue, I developed a Python-based system that automates and organizes the entire process.

##System Workflow:
### 1) File Submission: Members send their .gcode files through a designated Telegram group.
### 2) File Management: The system automatically downloads the .gcode files from the group and schedules them in an Excel file.
### 3) GUI Interaction: Members can interact with a user-friendly graphical interface (GUI) either in person or through a private Telegram chat. They are presented with options to:
Print the file
Not print the file and delete
Schedule the print for later
### 4) Automated Printing: Once the member makes a selection, the system sends the .gcode to the 3D printer via a serial port. The file is copied onto the printer's built-in SD card, and the print begins automatically, without the need for further human interaction.
## Features:
### 1) Easy to Use: The system is designed with simplicity in mind, making it accessible for all members.
### 2) Time-Efficient: It automates the printing process, reducing manual involvement and saving time.
### 3) Organized Scheduling: Files are managed and organized efficiently, ensuring smooth scheduling of print jobs.
### 4) Data Security: The system includes safe data encryption for file management and communication.
This system streamlines our 3D printing workflow, enhancing productivity and ensuring reliable and organized print management for the club.
